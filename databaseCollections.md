cf. https://github.com/kellerj/command-line-time-tracker

The application uses three collections to store all the data.

* `projects` : Project names
* `features`: Feature names
* `tasks` : Task descriptions
* `types`: Types of a timeEntries - document
* `timeEntries`: The smallest "unit" of this time-tracker: started and (only once) stopped

### Collection: `projects`

| name      | String    |                             |
| projectId | String    | uuid for a specific project |

### Collection: `features`

| Property   | Data Type | Notes                                          |
|:-----------|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------|

| featureId  | String    | uuid for a specific feature in a project       |
| _projectId | String    | projectId - property of a projects - document  |
| _taskIds   | Array     | each entry represents a task (finished or not) |

### Collection: `tasks`

| Property      | Data Type | Notes                                         |
|:--------------|:----------|:----------------------------------------------|
| _id           | ObjectId  | Auto-Generated by MongoDB                     |
| name          | String    |                                               |
| taskId        | String    | uuid for a specific task in a feature         |

| duration      | Number    | the (current) summarized duration in minutes  |
| _timeEntryIds | Array     | timeEntryIds of a timeEntries - documents     |

<!-- a time entry should not be reused for several start - stop operations -->
<!-- each start - stop operation should be stored -->
<!-- each start - stop operation should increase the (current) duration in the tasks - document -->
<!-- the (current) duration in the tasks - document should be realized as duration (in minutes) property -->
<!-- the current duration should be visualized on the UI (perhaps as server push event / or as set-interval approach in the UI) in hours and minutes -->

### Collection: `types`

| Property | Data Type | Notes                                   |

| typeId   | String    | uuid for a type of timeEntry document   |

### Collection: `timeEntries`

| Property          | Data Type | Notes                                                                     |

| startTime         | Date      | time stamp when the document was created, i.e. a task was started         |
| endTime           | Date      | time stamp when the task was stopped, i.e. this property is normally null |
| duration          | Number    | duration in minutes, i.e. this property is normally null                  |
| description       | String    | an optional description, i.e. by default ths property is null             |
| timeEntryId       | String    | uuid for a specific timeEntry                                             |
